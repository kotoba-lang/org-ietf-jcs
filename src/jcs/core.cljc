;; jcs.core — RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme.
;;
;; Canonicalizes a Clojure value into the single byte sequence RFC 8785 defines
;; for it, so that two parties who hold the same logical document produce the
;; same bytes and therefore the same signature. This is the transformation step
;; of the `eddsa-jcs-2022` cryptosuite (W3C vc-di-eddsa); nothing here signs.
;;
;; The four rules that actually matter, all from RFC 8785 §3.2:
;;
;;   1. Object members are sorted by property name, compared as arrays of UTF-16
;;      code units treated as unsigned integers (§3.2.3). Both hosts' native
;;      string compare already does exactly this, so `sort-by` on the raw name
;;      is the rule, not an approximation of it.
;;   2. No whitespace anywhere (§3.2.1).
;;   3. Strings escape ONLY `"` and `\`, plus C0 controls — U+0008/09/0A/0C/0D as
;;      \b \t \n \f \r and every other control as LOWERCASE \uhhhh (§3.2.2.2).
;;      Everything else, including `/` and all non-ASCII, is emitted literally
;;      as UTF-8.
;;   4. Numbers serialize as ECMAScript Number::toString (§3.2.2.3, ECMA-262
;;      7.1.12.1). NaN and Infinity MUST terminate with an error (§3.2.2.3).
;;
;; PORTABLE (.cljc). :cljs delegates number serialization to the host, because
;; in JavaScript `Number.prototype.toString` IS the algorithm the RFC cites.
;; :clj must reconstruct it: see `shortest-digits` for why Double/toString is
;; not usable directly.
;;
;;   (require '[jcs.core :as jcs])

;; ECMA-262 7.1.12.1 needs (s, k, n): the shortest decimal digit string s of
;; length k, with n placing the decimal point, such that s x 10^(n-k) == x.
;;
;; On the JVM, Double/toString is NOT a usable source of s. Even with the JDK 19
;; shortest-repr fix (JDK-4511638) it is specified to produce *a* round-tripping
;; representation, and for Double/MIN_VALUE it yields "4.9E-324" where ECMAScript
;; — and RFC 8785's own Appendix B sample — require "5e-324". Trusting it would
;; make the canonical form host-dependent, which defeats the entire point.
;;
;; So derive s directly: `new BigDecimal(double)` is the EXACT binary value, and
;; rounding it to p significant digits and checking the result still parses back
;; to x finds the true shortest p. HALF_UP on a positive value implements
;; ECMA-262's tie rule ("if there are two such possible values of s, choose the
;; larger s") because the magnitude is always positive here — the sign is split
;; off by `number->str` before this is called.
